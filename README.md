# Jukto: Connect Everything, Search Anything.

*Jukto* (from the Bangla word for “`connected`”) is an agentic platform that unifies your apps, databases, and tools into a single, intelligent search layer for AI agents and teams. By syncing data seamlessly and enabling AI-driven, context-aware searches, Jukto empowers developers to build smarter agents faster, with a focus on customization, privacy, and community extensibility.

##  The Challenge:

AI agents often struggle with vague or conversational queries, such as:  
- “What’s the status of our latest Jira/Linear/Asana sprint?”  
- “Pull up the client notes from last week’s Google Drive doc.”  
- “Check if we’ve paid the latest Slack invoice.”

Without a unified data layer, agents resort to brittle API calls, manual data lookups, or worse—hallucinated responses. Existing solutions like Model Context Protocol (MCP) enable app interactions but lack robust, semantic search across diverse tools, leaving developers to build complex integrations from scratch.

## Our Solution:

*Jukto* connects your apps, databases, and APIs into a single, searchable ecosystem. It handles authentication, data syncing, and AI-driven search, so your agents can focus on delivering value, not wrestling with infrastructure.

*Jukto* gives your agents a powerful, customizable search API. Your users get fast, accurate, and secure experiences.

## Features:

- **Unified Search API**: Query all your tools through a single REST or async API, with natural language support.  
- **Custom Connectors**: Build and share integrations for any app or database using our modular framework.  
- **Privacy-First**: End-to-end encryption and local data processing ensure compliance and security.  
- **Supported Formats**: Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), images (PNG, JPEG), spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV), and more.
